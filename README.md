# 3DMaking

simple sinatra website

load photos from FB, creates photogallery (and in the near future, a small paypal based ecommerce)


### there is another project inside 3dmaking: 3dshop!

sorry for the mess but look into 3dshop project (and 3dshop/Readme.md)

if you like any of these: Cura (CuraEngine), ruby slicing on the fly, gcode visualization with threejs (integrated a vendored lib)
